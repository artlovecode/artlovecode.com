# Learning to exploit, for fun and profit

Hey all, my name is Audun, and I'm learning to make computers do things they weren't supposed to.

This is mostly for fun, somewhat for profit. Hopefully, I'll be able to write some interesting CTF writeups here, and maybe even one day, a writeup of a real life bug bounty

This is pretty new for me, and it's hard to find newcomer resources, so I figured I'd make one as I go!

Currently, I'm playing a lot with HackerOne's CTf, and I've ordered a handful of books. 

Feel free to follow me on twitter, [@artlovecode](https://twitter.com/artlovecode). See you around!
